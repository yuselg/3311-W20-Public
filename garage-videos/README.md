### Design Goals

We have various customers who run a showroom for new and old cars. 

* Allow new cars to be added to the system
* Cars have properties such as year, model, and mileage, etc.
* Each customer has a different way of representing the model. 
* There are specialized kinds of cars e.g. electric cars
* Search for cars in different ways
* Ensure the correctness and consistency of the data
* Ensure that the system is maintainable 
* Uniformly iterate over the collection of cars in the garage (e.g. at stock taking time for balance sheet and taxes)
